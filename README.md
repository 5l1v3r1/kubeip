# kIP (pronounced as 'kÉªp')
* Build the images
	* Install go/dep (Go dependency management tool) using instructions at `https://github.com/golang/dep`
	* Run `dep ensure`
	* Build and push your image `make builder-image; make binary-image;  docker tag  kip gcr.io/my-project/kip; gcloud docker -- push gcr.io/my-project/kip`
* Replace `image: "gcr.io/my-project/kip"` to your project name and version in `deploy/kip-deployment.yaml`

* Create a service account with permission the following roles:
	* Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin
	* Storage Admin
	* Compute Admin
* Download the key file in JSON format
* Create secret - `kubectl create secret generic kip-key --from-file=key.json=filename`
* Create reserved ip address. By default kip looks form label "kip" with a value "reserved". You can override this by setting
KIP_LABEl_KEY and KIP_LABEl_VALUE in kip-configmap.yaml. A common practice is to assign a unique value per cluster (for example cluster name)
* Deploy - `kubctl apply -f deploy/.`
