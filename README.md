# kIP (pronounced as 'kÉªp')

**Prerequisites**
You need a Kubernetes 1.10 or newer cluster. You will also need Docker and kubectl 1.10.x or newer installed on your machine, as well as the Google Cloud SDK. You can install the Google Cloud SDK (which will also install kubectl) [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk).

**Build the images**

	* Install go/dep (Go dependency management tool) using instructions at (https://github.com/golang/dep)
	* Run `dep ensure`
	* Build and push your image `make builder-image; make binary-image;  docker tag  kip gcr.io/my-project/kip; gcloud docker -- push gcr.io/my-project/kip`
* Replace `image: "gcr.io/my-project/kip"` to your project name and version in `deploy/kip-deployment.yaml`

**Create a service account with permission the following roles**

	* Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin
	* Storage Admin
	* Compute Admin
* Download the key file in JSON format
* Create secret - `kubectl create secret generic kip-key --from-file=key.json=filename`
* Create reserved ip address. By default kip looks form label "kip" with a value "reserved". You can override this by setting
KIP_LABEl_KEY and KIP_LABEl_VALUE in kip-configmap.yaml. A common practice is to assign a unique value per cluster (for example cluster name)
* Deploy - `kubctl apply -f deploy/.`
