# kIP (pronounced as 'kÉªp')

**Prerequisites**

You need a Kubernetes 1.10 or newer cluster. You will also need Docker and kubectl 1.10.x or newer installed on your machine, as well as the Google Cloud SDK. You can install the Google Cloud SDK (which will also install kubectl) [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk).

**Build the images**

Install go/dep (Go dependency management tool) using [these instructions](https://github.com/golang/dep)

 - Run `dep ensure`

Build and push the image 
 - Set project with `gcloud config set project my_project` and replace the my_project with your [project_id](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects)
 - Run `export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)')`
 - Compile the kIP with `make builder-image`
 - build the Docker image with compiled version of kIP `make binary-image`
 - Tag the image using `docker tag  kip gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/kip`
 - Push the image to Google Container Registry with `docker push gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/kip`

**Create IAM Service Account and obtain the Key in JSON format**

Create Service Account: `gcloud iam service-accounts create kip-service-account --display-name "kIP"`

Attach required roles to the service account:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding kip-service-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--member=serviceAccount:kip-service-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role='roles/container.clusterAdmin,roles/compute.storageAdmin,roles/compute.admin'
```

Generate the Key using the following command:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
--iam-account kip-service-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
 
**Create Kubernetes Secret**

Create secret by running `kubectl create secret generic kip-key --from-file=key.json=filename`

**Create static reserved IP addresses:** 

By default **kip** looks for label "kip" with a value "reserved". You can override this by setting `KIP_LABEl_KEY` and `KIP_LABEl_VALUE` in kip-configmap.yaml. 

A common practice is to assign a unique value per cluster (for example cluster name)

Deploy by running `kubctl apply -f deploy/.`
